        <h4>Online German B1 Language Course</h4>
        <p>
          Step into intermediate-level German with Prizma Academy’s Online
          German B1 Language Course, designed for learners who have completed A2
          or already possess a solid foundation in the language. At this stage,
          you will enhance your ability to communicate effectively in more
          complex situations, both personally and professionally. The course
          emphasizes fluency, comprehension, and confidence in conversations,
          while also strengthening grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures.
          You will practice reading and analyzing longer texts, writing emails
          or short essays, and understanding discussions on familiar topics. Our
          certified trainers use interactive methods—live sessions, assignments,
          and real-world practice—to ensure you develop strong listening and
          speaking skills. With flexible online schedules and small group
          learning, the course is tailored to fit both students and working
          professionals. By the end of the B1 course, you will be able to
          express ideas, describe experiences, and interact with native speakers
          with improved clarity and accuracy.
